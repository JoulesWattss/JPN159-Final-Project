                        <h3>Birth of a Genre</h3>
                        <div class="expandable-content">
                            <p>Released in June 1978 in Japan, Space Invaders didn't see immediate success. But by year's end, 
                            over 100,000 arcade machines had been sold. The game was so popular it caused a shortage of 100-yen coins!</p>
                            <p>Originally titled "Space Monsters," the game was renamed by Nishikado's superiors. It combined 
                            the space theme from anime with Breakout's gameplay, creating the template for all shoot 'em up games.</p>
                            <p>The game's success was so unprecedented that it single-handedly created the arcade industry 
                            as we know it, inspiring countless imitators and establishing the business model for decades.</p>

                        <h3>Simple Yet Revolutionary</h3>
                        <div class="expandable-content">
                            <p>The beauty of Space Invaders lies in its simplicity: slide left and right, fire one missile at a time, 
                            defend Earth from 55 aliens marching in formation. The ominous marching sound speeds up as you destroy ships, 
                            building tension with every shot.</p>
                            <p>Like all games of its era, Space Invaders is futile—you will always lose, and the aliens will always win. 
                            But how long can you last? That eternal challenge defined arcade gaming.</p>
                            <p>The game introduced concepts that became standard: destructible cover, increasing difficulty, 
                            and the psychological pressure of an advancing enemy that gets faster as you succeed.</p>

                        <h3>The First Licensing Deal</h3>
                        <div class="expandable-content">
                            <p>In 1980, Atari programmer Rick Maurer created a port for the Atari 2600, leading to the first official 
                            licensing of an arcade game to a home console. The home version sold over 1 million copies in its first year, 
                            turning the Atari 2600 into a massive success.</p>
                            <p>The Atari version boasted "112 video games"—actually just variations including moving shields, 
                            zigzagging missiles, and invisible invaders. This set the template for home gaming adaptations.</p>
                            <p>This licensing deal established the business model that would dominate gaming for decades: 
                            successful arcade games being adapted for home consoles, creating multiple revenue streams.</p>

                        <h3>Cultural Phenomenon</h3>
                        <div class="expandable-content">
                            <p>Space Invaders became one of the most widely ported games ever, appearing on everything from LED handhelds 
                            to digital watches. It kicked off the entire shoot 'em up genre, inspiring Galaga, Galaxian, Defender, and countless others.</p>
                            <p>The game's grid of aliens, shield barriers, and bonus UFO became iconic gaming symbols. Its influence extends 
                            far beyond gaming—the pixelated alien is now a universal symbol of retro gaming culture.</p>
                            <p>The success led to the "golden age" of arcade gaming (1978-1983), during which video games 
                            became a dominant form of entertainment and a multi-billion dollar industry.</p>
