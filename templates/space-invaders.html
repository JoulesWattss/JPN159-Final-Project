                        <h3>Birth of a Genre</h3>
                        <p>Released in June 1978 in Japan, Space Invaders didn't see immediate success. But by year's end, 
                        over 100,000 arcade machines had been sold. The game was so popular it caused a shortage of 100-yen coins!</p>
                        <p>Originally titled "Space Monsters," the game was renamed by Nishikado's superiors. It combined 
                        the space theme from anime with Breakout's gameplay, creating the template for all shoot 'em up games.</p>

                        <h3>Simple Yet Revolutionary</h3>
                        <p>The beauty of Space Invaders lies in its simplicity: slide left and right, fire one missile at a time, 
                        defend Earth from 55 aliens marching in formation. The ominous marching sound speeds up as you destroy ships, 
                        building tension with every shot.</p>
                        <p>Like all games of its era, Space Invaders is futile—you will always lose, and the aliens will always win. 
                        But how long can you last? That eternal challenge defined arcade gaming.</p>

                        <h3>The First Licensing Deal</h3>
                        <p>In 1980, Atari programmer Rick Maurer created a port for the Atari 2600, leading to the first official 
                        licensing of an arcade game to a home console. The home version sold over 1 million copies in its first year, 
                        turning the Atari 2600 into a massive success.</p>
                        <p>The Atari version boasted "112 video games"—actually just variations including moving shields, 
                        zigzagging missiles, and invisible invaders. This set the template for home gaming adaptations.</p>

                        <h3>Cultural Phenomenon</h3>
                        <p>Space Invaders became one of the most widely ported games ever, appearing on everything from LED handhelds 
                        to digital watches. It kicked off the entire shoot 'em up genre, inspiring Galaga, Galaxian, Defender, and countless others.</p>
                        <p>The game's grid of aliens, shield barriers, and bonus UFO became iconic gaming symbols. Its influence extends 
                        far beyond gaming—the pixelated alien is now a universal symbol of retro gaming culture.</p>
