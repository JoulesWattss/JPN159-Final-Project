                    "Video games are unusual products that differ from other industrial goods in which electrical power, 
                    machines and creative work is integrated. They are an aggregation of a variety of disciplines, 
                    including engineering, literature, the arts, psychology, and can be considered a cultural tool 
                    for the 'fun' required by society."

                        <h3>Breaking Gender Barriers</h3>
                        <p>In the late 1970s, arcades were dominated by violent "kill the alien" games aimed at teenage boys. 
                        Iwatani wanted to create "a brighter and more fun place where women and couples could feel comfortable going."</p>
                        <p>His insight? "Women also enjoy the act of eating, or 'taberu' in Japanese." This simple observation 
                        led to one of gaming's most revolutionary concepts.</p>

                        <h3>The Birth of a Character</h3>
                        <p>Originally named "PuckMan" from the Japanese phrase "paku paku taberu" (gobbling something up), 
                        the character's design came from a pizza with a slice missing. When brought to America, 
                        Midway changed the name fearing vandalism would turn the "P" into an "F".</p>
                        <p>The ghosts were inspired by Japanese manga "Little Ghost Q-Taro" and American cartoon 
                        "Casper the Friendly Ghost," with their cat-and-mouse dynamic borrowed from "Tom and Jerry."</p>

                        <h3>Simplicity as Strategy</h3>
                        <p>Pac-Man required no buttons—just a joystick. This accessibility, combined with its 
                        "easy to learn, difficult to master" gameplay, created an addictive loop that appealed to everyone.</p>
                        <p>The simple, friendly design allowed for endless variations: Ms. Pac-Man, Super Pac-Man, 
                        and countless merchandise opportunities, from lunchboxes to a hit song.</p>

                        <h3>Cultural Phenomenon</h3>
                        <p>By 1987, nearly 300,000 arcade units had been sold worldwide. The game spawned a Saturday morning cartoon, 
                        breakfast cereal, and even a top 10 hit song. When Google created a playable logo in 2010, 
                        it cost the world $120 million in lost productivity.</p>
                        <p>It took 20 years for Billy Mitchell to achieve the first perfect game—3,333,360 points 
                        on level 256, where a memory overflow makes the game unplayable.</p>
