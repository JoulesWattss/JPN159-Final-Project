                    "Video games are unusual products that differ from other industrial goods in which electrical power, 
                    machines and creative work is integrated. They are an aggregation of a variety of disciplines, 
                    including engineering, literature, the arts, psychology, and can be considered a cultural tool 
                    for the 'fun' required by society."

                        <div class="expandable-content">
                            <p>In the late 1970s, arcades were dominated by violent "kill the alien" games aimed at teenage boys. 
                            Iwatani wanted to create "a brighter and more fun place where women and couples could feel comfortable going."</p>
                            <p>His insight? "Women also enjoy the act of eating, or 'taberu' in Japanese." This simple observation 
                            led to one of gaming's most revolutionary concepts.</p>
                            <p>The game's non-violent nature and cute character design attracted a broader demographic, 
                            fundamentally changing who played video games and where they were played.</p>

                        <div class="expandable-content">
                            <p>Originally named "PuckMan" from the Japanese phrase "paku paku taberu" (gobbling something up), 
                            the character's design came from a pizza with a slice missing. When brought to America, 
                            Midway changed the name fearing vandalism would turn the "P" into an "F".</p>
                            <p>The ghosts were inspired by Japanese manga "Little Ghost Q-Taro" and American cartoon 
                            "Casper the Friendly Ghost," with their cat-and-mouse dynamic borrowed from "Tom and Jerry."</p>
                            <p>Each ghost had its own personality: Blinky (red) was aggressive, Pinky (pink) tried to ambush, 
                            Inky (cyan) was unpredictable, and Clyde (orange) was the least threatening.</p>

                        <h3>Simplicity as Strategy</h3>
                        <div class="expandable-content">
                            <p>Pac-Man required no buttons—just a joystick. This accessibility, combined with its 
                            "easy to learn, difficult to master" gameplay, created an addictive loop that appealed to everyone.</p>
                            <p>The simple, friendly design allowed for endless variations: Ms. Pac-Man, Super Pac-Man, 
                            and countless merchandise opportunities, from lunchboxes to a hit song.</p>
                            <p>The maze design was carefully crafted to create strategic choices while maintaining 
                            the game's accessibility. Every tunnel, corner, and power pellet placement was intentional.</p>

                        <h3>Cultural Phenomenon</h3>
                        <div class="expandable-content">
                            <p>By 1987, nearly 300,000 arcade units had been sold worldwide. The game spawned a Saturday morning cartoon, 
                            breakfast cereal, and even a top 10 hit song. When Google created a playable logo in 2010, 
                            it cost the world $120 million in lost productivity.</p>
                            <p>It took 20 years for Billy Mitchell to achieve the first perfect game—3,333,360 points 
                            on level 256, where a memory overflow makes the game unplayable.</p>
                            <p>The character became so iconic that it transcended gaming, appearing in art galleries, 
                            fashion, and becoming a symbol of 1980s pop culture that endures today.</p>
