                        <div class="expandable-content">
                            <p>Mario first appeared as "Jumpman" in 1981's Donkey Kong, created by a young Shigeru Miyamoto. 
                            He was renamed Mario in 1982 after Nintendo's warehouse landlord, Mario Segale, who burst in 
                            demanding overdue rent during a company meeting.</p>
                            <p>Miyamoto gave Mario his iconic look out of necessity: a cap because animating hair was difficult, 
                            a mustache to define his nose, and overalls to show arm movement clearly. Technical limitations 
                            became timeless design.</p>
                            <p>The character's profession changed from carpenter to plumber when he appeared in Mario Bros. (1983), 
                            setting up the pipe-filled world that would define the franchise.</p>

                        <h3>The Game That Changed Everything</h3>
                        <div class="expandable-content">
                            <p>Released in September 1985 for the Famicom in Japan, Super Mario Bros. arrived when the 
                            North American video game industry had collapsed. Revenues had fallen from $3.2 billion in 1983 
                            to just $100 million by 1985.</p>
                            <p>Nintendo's "Seal of Quality" and the exceptional gameplay of Super Mario Bros. restored 
                            retailer and consumer confidence. The game sold over 40 million copies, making it one of the 
                            best-selling games of all time.</p>
                            <p>The game's success in America was so complete that it essentially created the modern 
                            video game industry, establishing Nintendo as the dominant force for decades.</p>

                        <h3>Revolutionary Design</h3>
                        <div class="expandable-content">
                            <p>Super Mario Bros. introduced concepts that became industry standards: scrolling levels, 
                            hidden secrets, power-ups that changed gameplay, and a carefully crafted difficulty curve 
                            that taught through design.</p>
                            <p>The first Goomba forces you to learn jumping, the first pipe suggests exploration, 
                            the first block rewards curiosity. Every element was purposefully placed to guide players 
                            without explicit instruction.</p>
                            <p>The game's level design philosophy of "teaching without teaching" became the gold standard 
                            for game design, influencing countless developers and establishing design principles still used today.</p>

                        <h3>Cultural Renaissance</h3>
                        <div class="expandable-content">
                            <p>By 1990, Mario was more recognizable to American children than Mickey Mouse. The character 
                            spawned TV shows, movies, merchandise, and established video games as mainstream entertainment 
                            rather than a passing fad.</p>
                            <p>The Super Mario series has generated over $30 billion in revenue, becoming the best-selling 
                            video game franchise of all time and inspiring generations of game developers worldwide.</p>
                            <p>Mario's success proved that video games could be art, entertainment, and cultural touchstones 
                            that transcend age, gender, and cultural boundaries.</p>
