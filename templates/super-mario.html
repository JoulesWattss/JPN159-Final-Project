                        <h3>From Jumpman to Icon</h3>
                        <p>Mario first appeared as "Jumpman" in 1981's Donkey Kong, created by a young Shigeru Miyamoto. 
                        He was renamed Mario in 1982 after Nintendo's warehouse landlord, Mario Segale, who burst in 
                        demanding overdue rent during a company meeting.</p>
                        <p>Miyamoto gave Mario his iconic look out of necessity: a cap because animating hair was difficult, 
                        a mustache to define his nose, and overalls to show arm movement clearly. Technical limitations 
                        became timeless design.</p>

                        <h3>The Game That Changed Everything</h3>
                        <p>Released in September 1985 for the Famicom in Japan, Super Mario Bros. arrived when the 
                        North American video game industry had collapsed. Revenues had fallen from $3.2 billion in 1983 
                        to just $100 million by 1985.</p>
                        <p>Nintendo's "Seal of Quality" and the exceptional gameplay of Super Mario Bros. restored 
                        retailer and consumer confidence. The game sold over 40 million copies, making it one of the 
                        best-selling games of all time.</p>

                        <h3>Revolutionary Design</h3>
                        <p>Super Mario Bros. introduced concepts that became industry standards: scrolling levels, 
                        hidden secrets, power-ups that changed gameplay, and a carefully crafted difficulty curve 
                        that taught through design.</p>
                        <p>The first Goomba forces you to learn jumping, the first pipe suggests exploration, 
                        the first block rewards curiosity. Every element was purposefully placed to guide players 
                        without explicit instruction.</p>

                        <h3>Cultural Renaissance</h3>
                        <p>By 1990, Mario was more recognizable to American children than Mickey Mouse. The character 
                        spawned TV shows, movies, merchandise, and established video games as mainstream entertainment 
                        rather than a passing fad.</p>
                        <p>The Super Mario series has generated over $30 billion in revenue, becoming the best-selling 
                        video game franchise of all time and inspiring generations of game developers worldwide.</p>
