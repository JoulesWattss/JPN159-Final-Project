                    This interactive experience explores the intersection of classic arcade 
                    aesthetics and modern web technology. Through the lens of Pac-Man's 
                    iconic design language, we examine how simple geometric forms and 
                    vibrant colors can create compelling digital narratives.

                    The project serves as both homage and critique, celebrating the 
                    foundational elements of game design while questioning the boundaries 
                    between art, entertainment, and cultural expression in the digital age.
